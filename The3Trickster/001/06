// I created a method to do the check
// I assigned 2 parameters a and b
// I stored these 2 in int result
// Since I'm doing the validation in the method there is no need to return anything, this is the reason
// I created a void method, if I actually wanted to return int result I would have made my method an int
// and returned result that way I could assign it to an int in the main method. If I did it this way
// and printed out my result I returned I would have gotten just the value of a + b.
// With this void method when I create the object in the main method and assign it values, it passes
// these to the method parameters int a, int b and then runs the code block.
// If you guys have any questions I do not mind helping you out with my method or your own.
