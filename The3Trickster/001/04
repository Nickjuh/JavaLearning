// My way of doing this is a little more complicated for very beginning java programmers.
// I did it this way to make it more optimized.
// I could have just added a return a + b; in the method and did it this way.
// By doing it this way I'm only creating 3 ints which will only be ran when the method is called
// this helps with memory management.
