// For future reference, I always put what I can in a method because it helps keep clutter out of the main method
// and helps with debugging in bigger projects, this is a good practice to have.
// I created a method called switchIsSoFun and gave it a parameter of type int called day
// I then created all my cases and since I'm not returning a value but passing an arguemnt from the main method 
// to the switch method and not returning anything I just made it void.
// When I made my object in the main method I just used 1, this number can be changed to 1 - 7, one for 
// each day and if any other value is placed in there it will give an invalid expression.
// If you have any questions just ask.
