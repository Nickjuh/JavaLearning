/*Create an RPG game concept using only the command line.

The player starts with 100 health points, 0 experience points and is level 1.

Every time the player writes the letter 'x' to the console, the player will attack the enemy.

**Attacking** the enemy leads to:

Player gains 5 experience points;
Player loses 1 health point.

Every time the player writes the letter 'y' to the console, the player will heal himself.

**Healing** himself leads to:

Player loses 1 experience point;
Player gains 5 health points.

**BONUS**: use System console outputs to make the gaming experience more realistic for a hypothetical end user.*/
